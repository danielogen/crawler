README for Inveneo Crawler

The Inveneo Crawler reads a set of host IPs from OpenNMS import XML files, and
then visits those hosts to do some housekeeping, such as pulling the latest
configuration and rebooting the host if it has been running a long time.

It generates a report in a form suitable for import into a spreadsheet.
